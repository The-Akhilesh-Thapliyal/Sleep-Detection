The Sleep Detection Project is a sophisticated system designed to enhance road safety by monitoring and detecting a driver's state of alertness in real-time. Drowsy driving poses a significant risk on the road, leading to accidents and fatalities. This project employs advanced deep learning techniques to analyze facial features and determine whether the driver is in a state of wakefulness or drowsiness. The system incorporates sleep detection algorithms, trained on diverse datasets, to precisely identify signs of fatigue or drowsiness in a driver's facial expressions.

The project's architecture is robust and scalable, allowing seamless integration into various vehicles and transportation systems. It provides a user-friendly interface and customizable thresholds for sensitivity, making it adaptable to different driver preferences and road conditions. In addition to real-time detection, the system includes an alert mechanism to promptly notify the driver when signs of drowsiness are detected, thereby preventing potential accidents. The Sleep Detection Project is a crucial step towards improving road safety by addressing the dangers associated with drowsy driving, contributing to the overall well-being of both drivers and other road users.
